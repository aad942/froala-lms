# A Simple React LMS built on Froala and Filestack

This is a demo LMS that showcases image upload and transformations, along with WYSIWYG editing using Froala Editor and its built-in Filestack functionality. Before using or testing this code, please make sure that you've replaced all paths with sample directories, e.g. "path-to-backend/". Additionally, please be sure to replace the "YourFilestackAPIKey" part on FroalaComponent.jsx with your actual key (you can get one for free on https://www.filestack.com/signup-free/). Enjoy and thank you!

# A Simple React LMS built on Froala and Filestack

This is a demo LMS that showcases image upload and transformations, along with WYSIWYG editing using Froala Editor and its built-in Filestack functionality. Before using or testing this code, please make sure that you've replaced all paths with sample directories, e.g. "path-to-backend/". Additionally, please be sure to replace the "YourFilestackAPIKey" part on FroalaComponent.jsx with your actual key (you can get one for free on https://www.filestack.com/signup-free/). For the full explanation of how to implement this demo, check out this blog post: https://froala.com/blog/general/how-to-transform-your-lms-with-a-react-wysiwyg-html-editor-part-1/. Enjoy and thank you!
